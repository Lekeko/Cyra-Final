The stones here are just like the corals above the barrier, colorful and beautiful with nice calming scenery to look at.  It seems that this place doesn't lack vegetation and fauna at all. These places are filled to the brim with colorful fish ",

                  " and, after further analysis, it seems that these Crystals  are made from Rose Quartz and Kyanite, and the light that they emit can last up to 200 years! ",
                  " \tThe plants here seem very strange and very different from the surface, bushes that emit light and dance, with trees that have traces of bioluminescence in them  and hanging vines. I wish that there was no need for",

                  "These geodes are somewhat poor in materials, mostly getting like 4-5 crystals each, some don't even have crystals and look warned out, but there are so many of them it's  impossible to not stumble across one. With these crystals, ",
                  "I was able to come up with some gizmo concepts to easily traverse this land, a Strider so you can launch yourself  in the direction you are facing, and a special tool that",
                  " creates a magic platform, which disappears after a few seconds. I've made and presented them to my colleagues to see how they would use them and to no one's surprise, all of them went full frontal in every stone possible, ",
                  "It was hilarious. \tIn the middle layer, around 200 - 100 meters, there is this rare yellow ore that glows and it's really hard to mine, especially when you have to swim to be stable. ",
